## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the to-do list.

# How to Use

### Using this To-Do List App

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Start by typing your tasks list. Here's how the interaction works:

    - To **add** a task, follow the pattern:
      ```list
      add :-- <task>
      Example: add :-- eat
      ```
    - You can continue adding tasks similarly:
      ```
      add :-- sleep
      add :-- play
      ```
    - To view your current task list on console, type:
      ```
      list
      ```
      - Then `quit`:
      ```
      quit
      ```
    - To **delete** a task, first type `delete`, followed by the task index you want to remove. For example:
      ```text
      delete :-- 1
      ```
    - After deleting a task, you can view the updated list by typing `list` then `quit`.
    - To **quit** the webpage, simply type:
      ```text
      quit
      ```
